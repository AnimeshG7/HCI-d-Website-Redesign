                    <h3>Jeffrey Bardzell</h3>
                    <p>Jeffrey Bardzell is a Professor of Informatics and Director of the HCI/Design program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University–Bloomington. His research examines both design theory and emerging
                        social computing practices. His work on design theory has focused on critical design, research through design, and design criticism. His research on emerging social computing practices includes critical-empirical studies on maker
                        communities in the United States and Asia, intimate and sexual interaction, and online creative communities. A common thread throughout this work is the use of aesthetics—including the history of criticism, critical theory, and
                        analytic aesthetics—to understand how concepts, materials, forms, ideologies, experiential qualities, and creative processes achieve coherence in design objects. He is co-editor of Critical Theory and Interaction Design (MIT Press,
                        in press) and co-author of Humanistic HCI (Synthesis Lectures in Human-Centered Informatics). He is working on a monograph, tentatively titled, Design as Research. Bardzell’s work is funded by the National Science Foundation and
                        the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing.</p>

                    <p>Shaowen Bardzell is Professor of Informatics in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University and the Affiliated Faculty of the Kinsey Institute. Bardzell holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Indiana
                        University and pursues a humanistic research agenda within the research and practice of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A common thread throughout her work is the exploration of the contributions of feminism, design, and social
                        science to support technology’s role in social change. Recent research foci have included care ethics and feminist utopian perspectives on IT, research through design, women’s health, and posthumanist approaches to sustainable
                        design. Her work is supported by the National Science Foundation, Intel Corporation, and the Mellon Foundation among others. She is the co-editor of Critical Theory and Interaction Design (MIT Press, forthcoming) and co-author
                        of Humanistic HCI (Morgan & Claypool, 2015). She co-directs the Cultural Research in Technology (CRIT) Lab at Indiana University.</p>
